      <p>I just couldn't work up the courage to talk to the cute girl in my <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/undergrad_studies/fye/cwe/">Camp War Eagle</a> (CWE) group, and when I did, it wasn't really my smoothest line. For many people with missed connections in CWE, this would be the end of the story. It certainly would have been, if not for a mutual friend and a bit of luck.</p>
      <p>For a while, we were only great friends, but a trip to Nashville with friends left us looking at each other in a different light.</p>

      <p>Dating in college was easy, we had (and still have) great friends and many fond memories &mdash; but after moving to NYC and and doing some old fashioned long distance dating (made so difficult because I hate the phone) &mdash; I was ready for her to move to NYC.</p>
      <p>With a bit of fortune on our side a job presented itself, after a year and a half of living in the same city, I knew the time was right to take it to the next level.</p>
