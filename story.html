      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <h2>His Version</h2>
      <p>I just couldn't work up the courage to talk to the cute girl in my <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/undergrad_studies/fye/cwe/">Camp War Eagle</a> (CWE) group, and when I did, it wasn't really my smoothest line. For many people with missed connections in CWE, this would be the end of the story. It certainly would have been, if not for a mutual friend and a bit of luck.</p>
      <p>For a while, we were only great friends, but a trip to Nashville with friends left us looking at each other in a different light.</p>
      <p>Dating in college was easy, we had (and still have) great friends and many fond memories &mdash; but after moving to NYC and and doing some old fashioned long distance dating (made so difficult because I hate the phone) &mdash; I was ready for her to move to NYC.</p>
      <p>With a bit of fortune on our side a job presented itself, after a year and a half of living in the same city, I knew the time was right to take it to the next level.</p>
      <h2>Her Version</h2>
      <p>Well, after Jud's first line at Camp War Eagle fell flat ("Wow, you're tall."), you'd think I'd never have thought of Captain Obvious again. But there was something about his southern accent, swoop and whit that stuck with me.</p>
      <p>Jud and I were both blessed with really special groups of friends at Auburn. Luckily for us, these groups crossed paths freshman year. For the next year, we were great friends. It wasn't until a trip to Nashville that we realized there was the potential for more. Let me tell you, it wasn't easy convincing Jud that we should date (you see, his hair made him quite a hot commodity amongst sorority girls). Once he gave in, the last 2 years of college were unforgettable. We had so much fun with each other and with our amazing friends. </p>
      <p>Post-college wasn't as simple. Long-distance proved to be just as frustrating (and expensive!) as everyone warned us it would be. By a stroke of luck, a job in NYC presented itself in July of 2012 and 2 weeks later, I had a one-way ticket to Brooklyn. </p>
      <p>I supposed he did have 5 years to think about it, but Jud's proposal was PERFECT (feel free to read more <a href="proposal.html">here</a>)! Jud has been my best friend for a long time and I'm so excited for him to be my husband!</p>
