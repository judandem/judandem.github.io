      <h2>December 25, 2013</h2>
      <p>It had been a great Christmas break at home so far. Jud spent some time in Nashville before we parted ways on the 23rd for him to go see his family, with plans for me to head to Decatur and join them on the 26th. For Christmas morning, my mom tried to convince us we'd be doing it differently - essentially we were suppose to get dressed after breakfast . Well, we were pretty resistant to the change - there was no way we'd get out of our pajamas before noon... This is why we should always listen to our parents. </p>
      <p>Just when everything was wrapping up, my dad found one more present under the tree. It was to "Em", but had no from. I opened a beautiful ornament and was trying to figure out who to thank when my dad suggested there should be something else in there. There was a note that read "the second part is at the front door". Now - I have to divert for a second. Jud and I had been talkin throughout the morning, sending pictures of our new gifts, etc. So walking to the front door I had NO indication it may be him. </p>
      <p>When I walked out he said "I bet you're surprised to see me". Well, I lost it. It was a beautiful, perfect moment. Turns out all of the Stephenson's had spent the night in Nashville and we got to spend Christmas with our families. I obviously said yes.</p>
